## Overview

Proof of Assets Protocol is an inventive solution, aspiring to bridge the gap between the traditional financial system and the decentralized financial (DeFi) system. The absence of a method for representing real-world assets in DeFi has stifled usability and adoption. Our protocol addresses this shortcoming by enabling the creation of Proof-of-Asset (PoA) tokens, a unique non-fungible token that validates asset ownership without disclosing sensitive information.

## The Problem

At present, there is no good way of representing traditional assets, such as real estate, in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. The implications of this omission/oversight are far-reaching, hindering adoption and obstructing the potential of DeFi infrastructure in countless areas, spanning from collateralized loans to centralized exchanges.

## Key Features

Proof of Assets Protocol allows users to mint Proof of Asset (PoA) tokens. Proof of Asset (PoA) is a non-fungible token (NFT) that serves as proof that you hold an asset without revealing information about the asset. Each token contains (1) a unique identifier, (2) a timestamp of token generation, (3) a dollar-value amount associated with the asset. Additionally, Proof of Asset PoA tokens are soulbound, meaning that they cannot be transferred.

## Business Model

A small fee is charged for token generation. This fee serves as a primary revenue stream for the project. The fee will be structured in a way that high-value assets will incur a higher fee (after further market research has been conducted).

## Use Cases

Proof of Asset PoA tokens have a wide range of use cases including:

**Centralized Exchanges:** Proof of Asset (PoA) tokens can be used to generate [Proof of Solvency](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/11/19/proof_of_solvency.html).

**Funding/Crowdsourcing:** Proof of Asset (PoA) tokens can be used to assure donors/investors/etc. that their funds are being directed towards their intended use.

**Collateralized Loans:** Proof of Asset (PoA) tokens can be used as a type of 'credit score' for collateralized loans in decentralized lending applications.

**Reputation Systems:** Proof of Asset (PoA) tokens can be used as a measure of trust/credibility in reputation systems.

## The Minting Process

1. **Document Upload**  
   A user uploads government-issued property assessment (for taxation purposes) to the Proof of Assets Protocol platform

2. **AI Image Processing**  
   A finetuned mobileBERT model performs fraud detection and determines the value of the asset

3. **ZK Proof Generation**  
   A zero-knowledge proof is generated from the output of the model

4. **PoA Minted**  
   The proof is verified on-chain and a Proof of Asset (PoA) is minted
